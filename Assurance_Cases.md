**Evidence Review**
- E1 - As far as I can tell, ITFlow uses the "PHPMailer" library to send emails which uses opportunistic TLS to encrypt data. This could leave the application vulnerable if an attacker is in the network already. This may be considerably secure for most environments with mitigating controls. 
- E2 - Encryption is done through various means. Mailing uses "PHPMailer SMTPSecure" for TLS encryption. Mail encryption supports SSL and TLS, leaving the choice of security to the user (I'd love to see SSL deprecated and only support TLS1.2 or higher). Other forms of encryption utilizes standard HTTPS encryption protocols including OpenSSL. Login information is enforced via HTTPS.  
- E3 - Reference diagram contained in this document. 
- E4 - Key generation function in https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/blob/master/api_key_add_modal.php calls "randomString(156)" in line 2. This has sufficient complexity (156 characters sanitized for HTML). 
- E5 - Reference diagram contained in this document. 
- E6 - ITFlow documents sensitive security events through robust audit log entries in its code. This is peppered throughout various security functions. 
- E7 - https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/commits/master
- E8 - Randomization uses a documented PHP function called "random_bytes" (https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php) to generate a randomized string. The "randomString" function then trims the string to create URL safe keys. This function is sufficiently secure. 
- E9 - Overview of PKI implementation appears to follow X.509 standards. 

***Summary: ITFlow appears to implement the evidence items crafted in my assurance case diagram with only minor variations.***

### 1.5 Assurance Case 5: Role-Based Access Control
**Assurance Case:**   ITFlow provides secure access to roles in the environment.

### 1.6 Assurance Case 6: Workflow Automation and Documentation Security
**Assurance Case:**  ITFlow provides appropriate secure tracking of documentation and workflows.

## Part 2: Evidence Alignment Observations
### 2.1 Assurance Case 1
#### *2.1.1 Available Evidence*
***E4 - Manual review of password related source code*** \
In the [password rotation documentation](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/blob/5b49d35f1a0241060c0f83ee696aa53df2f3c782/report_password_rotation.php#L4) it was validated that ITFlow will lock out user accounts where the passwords had not been changed within the last 90 days.  In addition, a report of these accounts is also made available to users with elevated access privileges for review/escalation purposes. As such, this control was considered to be sufficient to ensure passwords were being periodically changed to minimize the risk of brute force attacks.<br><br>
***E6 - Test results from attempting to execute a stack overflow attack*** \
<br><br>
***E7 - Review of logging configuration report*** \
Review of the [login configuration documentation](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/blob/5b49d35f1a0241060c0f83ee696aa53df2f3c782/login.php) determined that 
ITFlow only required the following for a user to successfully login:
- Users are required to login from a HTTPS address for enhanced security.
- Users are required to enter a valid MFA key.
- User must not have had multipe failed login attempts (e.g., >=15) from a single IP address.
- User must be attempting to login from an IP address associated with a previously successful login attempt.  If not, an email is to be sent to the users designated email address notifying them of the unusual login attempt.

Based on consideration for these requirements and detection methods being used, it was determined that ITFlow sufficiently monitors user accounts for abnormalities in order to reduce the risk of unauthorized access attempts<br><br>
#### *2.1.2 Insufficient Evidence*
***E2 - Manual review of source code*** \
In the [log settings documentation](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/blob/cd006d0625d638880fe3d6e1c4210eb14e504dbd/logs.php#L17) ITFlow logs IP addresses associated with each login attempt.  This information is retained within an Audit Log document within the database.  This information is then reviewed in future login attempts as part of the [login settings documentation](https://github.com/itflow-org/itflow/blob/cd006d0625d638880fe3d6e1c4210eb14e504dbd/login.php#L3) where if fifteen or more failed login attempts are identified, then the corresponding IP address is automatically locked out by the system.  Based on this information and the results of the manual review of the source code, it was believed that while this control will likely block some brute force attacks, it could easily be bypassed by periodically changing IP addresses.  Further, if a threat actor just wanted to lockout the system, they could identify the IP information being using by the organization leveraging the system and repeatedly block access to the organization via a bot.  As such, this control was not considered sufficient.<br><br>
***E3 - ITFlow Password Policy*** \
This evidence is unavailable, an we believe it needs to be completed for ITFlow to ensure more complex passwords are being leveraged by users to reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks.
<br><br>

### 2.2 Assurance Case 2
#### *2.2.1 Available Evidence*
***E1 - Software is kept up to date*** \
IT Flow has built database updates and version logs into the doumentation. A mechanism to maintain current versions exists. Maintaining the updates will be up to the user, but IT Flow faciliates an easy way for the user to do this.

***E3 - Documentation indicates IT Flow uses HTML Purifier*** \
In researching the code for IT FLow, it was found the software uses HTML Purifier, a PHP plugin, to sanitize HTML input. HTML Purifier allows developers to create whitelists, or more complex policies as needed. HTML Purifier is quite extensive, it looks to have protects against inserting malicious schemas into an SQL database as well.

***E5 - Assurance Case on Login Creddential Security*** \
User access to the database is password protected. The security of passwords and accounts is extensively detailed in the login Credential Assurance Case.

#### *2.2.2 Insufficent Evidence*

***E2 - User input is escaped*** \
While the software uses HTML purifier to sanitize html input, no indication was foudn that the software escapes all input to normalize text. Normalizing text helps prevent malicious SQL queries from being executed as code.

***E4 - IT Flow follows AES as a standard*** \
IT FLow most likely uses some kind of encryption to protect the database, and other functions, no evidence was found that points to a specific type of encryption. It would be recomended to floow the AES modern encryption standards.

### 2.6 Assurance Case 6
***E2 - Assurance Case on Login Credential Security*** \
***E3 - Assurance Case on MFA*** \
***E4 - Assurance Case on Login Credential Security*** \

## Teamwork Reflection

For this week's assignment, our team worked well together. We were able to have regularly scheduled meetings as well as add other meetings to accommodate the time necessary to plan out what was needed. One thing we did add this week to allow for more time for review of the diagrams of others was to ask that all diagrams be loaded into GitHub by Friday. This gave all team members the time to review and add comments where necessary and gave time for those with comments on their diagrams to change those diagrams to better align with the evidence and comments given. 
The team did have some challenges defining the appropriate top-level claims that were applicable related to ITFlow. This challenge was largely addressed through additional meetings with team members to discuss and ensure alignment on what these top-level claims are and how they should be worded.
