## Reflection
For this week's assignment, our team worked well together. We were able to have regularly scheduled meetings as well as add other meetings to accomodate the time necessary to plan out what was needed. One thing we did add this week to allow for more time for review of the diagrams of others was to ask that all diagrams be loaded into Git Hub by Friday. This gave all team members the time to review and add comments where necessary and gave time for those with comments on their diagrams to change those diagrams to better align with the evidence and comments given. We were also able to flex with the changing schedules of those in our group due to illness and work needs coming up throughout the week. Overall, the group continues to work well together and meet all necessary course requirements.
