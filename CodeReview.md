# Code review
	We chose to do an automated review because none of 
	our group members are exceptionally good at coding and/or 
	identifying vulnerabilities in raw code. Before even beginning, 
	our team knew this would be a challenge. Thus, automated review to address this challenge.
	The code review software we used is called Synk. It integrates well with GitHub and
	is easy to use and import multiple open-source projects.
	In addition, it is exceptionally good at analysis.
	Not only does it identify potential vulnerabilities, but it also
	performs a fix analysis based on the discovery and resolution of
	other open source projects it has scanned on Git Hub.
