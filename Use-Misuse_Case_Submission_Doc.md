In reviewing the forum for ITFlow, there was a ticket created for them to address an issue where an email was sent into the IT Helpdesk for a company and it continually created new tickets within the ITFlow dashboard. This could potentially cause problems if the emails were automatically routed to the folder to create a ticket, and since the parser runs with a cronjob, it could easily overload the dashboard, and eventually the IT Helpdesk workers. According to the forum, this issue was fixed with a code push 5 days ago.
