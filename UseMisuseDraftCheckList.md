# Assignment Part 1

## Here is what your team will need to accomplish. Build a markdown report that describes the following:

[] Identify five to six (depending on team size) essential interactions of your open-source software (system-of-interest) with its environment of operation. You will most likely identify these interactions based on the enabling systems or other systems in your systems engineering view (previous assignment). Ideally, the interactions would be spread across your software's different external interactors (humans or systems). Once different external interactors have been identified, the interactions can focus on the most critical features used by the external interactor.\
[] Develop use-cases diagrams of the five interactions. The use-cases should be about features supported by your software (system of interest). Keep these diagrams simple and avoid introducing complexity early.\ 
 - You may use the following sample file to have quick access to shapes for a use case diagram in https://app.diagrams.netLinks to an external site. 
 - Use Case Sample.drawio Download Use Case Sample.drawio 
 - For each use case, derive security requirements using misuse case analysis. 
 - The misusers should be contextualized in your environment of operation and relevant to the interactions identified above. Use names for misusers that help the reader understand their motives, resources, attack of choice, and the available access to the system to carry out their attack.
 - Here is a sample file to have quick access to shapes for a use/misuse case diagram in https://app.diagrams.netLinks to an external site.:
 - Use-Misuse Case Sample.drawio Download Use-Misuse Case Sample.drawio  
 - Iterate between use and misuse cases to elaborate additional security functions. This step is important to derive quality security requirements. Embed the final diagram in your report.
 - Diagraming Advice: Use proper notation as discussed in class materials. Use cases should focus on software features. Go back and forth between use case and misuse case analysis until specific functional security requirements that are implemented by the software can be identified. For misuse cases, prioritize mitigations that are implemented in the OSS project, instead of the environment. Make sure use cases address all misuse cases. Arrange the diagram appropriately to reduce clutter.
 - Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations. Provide a summary of your findings.\

[] *Show your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task in a Github Project Board.*\
[] Provide a link to this board.\ 
[] Include a summary of your individual contributions.\
[] Include a reflection of your teamwork for this assignment. What issues occurred? How did you resolve them? What did you plan to change moving forward?\ 

# Assignment Part 2

## Continue to develop your markdown report further with the following:

[] Review OSS project documentation for security-related configuration and installation issues. Summarize your observations.
 - The purpose of this task is to review security-related documentation of the project and find ways to improve it. Open source projects are always looking for contributors for their documentation. It may also allow you to get to know the open source community and procedures to contribute.
